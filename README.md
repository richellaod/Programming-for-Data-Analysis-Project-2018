# Programming for Data Analysis Project 2018

This project concerns creating a data set by similating a real world phenomenon and to model and synthesise the data using Python. The below tasks are carried out in this project:

* Choose a real world phenomenon tht can be measured and for which I can collect at least 100 data points across at least 4 different variables
* Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions and their relationships with one another.
* Simulate a data set as closely matchng theri properties as possible.
* Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook - the data itself can be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.
